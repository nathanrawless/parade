Another challenge from Frontend Mentor. In design image, although it seems simple with basic layouts, I struggled a bit during this project because of too many variants of colors, text styles, sizes, and different spacings especially when i dont have design source. I should consider that first to focus on layout better and to start with mobile-first overflow. And much better to not work with a general reset file...

I tried to focus more on SASS shorthands and write faster and easier code with SASS.

- Toggle menu with only CSS
- I used the Flexbox for layout
- Responsive on larger, medium, and smaller screens
- Hover effects on some images and links
